1. Create Redux Store
import { createStore } from "redux";
import reducer from "../reducers";

const initialState = { tech: "React " };
export const store = createStore(reducer, initialState);

////////////
create store 
////////////





2. //The Store (Bank Vault) and the Reducer (Cashier) communicate with each other

Reducer is a function in Redux that takes two parameters. One is STATE of the app and the other is ACTION. 

function reducer (state, action) {
	switch (action.type) {
		case "withdraw_money":
			//do something
			break;
		case "deposit-money":
			//do something
			break;
		default:
			return state;
		}
		
}

3.Action

When you are dispatching an action, it passes through the Reducer (cashier) to store
